I'm Jim Carrey, my ship has been demolished near Madagascar and my supplies are low. If anyone can hear this please help. I am trapped in the base of the H.I., I still haven't worked out worked yet but I'm certain that the first word is horrific. Life here isn't good, people disappear every day. People say it's because they execute people, but I think it's something else more terrible. Is this thing still on......... Help.............No..................Aaargh.
